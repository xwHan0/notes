<h1>Hierarchy Space Management</h1>
<p>In some scenarios, the total space should not distribute into the final users directly. There may be severial middle layers who is  looked like a virtual user between final users and total space. This application is called hierarchy space management.</p>
<p>For example, the total resource is shared by two user group, and each group includes some users. The total resource is distributed into these two groups firstly, then tje final users share the corresponding group space. That means the user who is belong to group #1 only uses and shares the space of group #1.</p>
<p>In hierarchy application, the sub level total space comes from parent distribution, like dynamic threshold.</p>
